## Background

After building my last portfolio site with some CSS libraries and JS, I knew I wanted to do a lot more with it.
I didn't like the scroll experience with my mouse (turned out it was just a USB connectivity problem, sorry mouse!), so I thought it'd be a great idea to do it in React
so I could render everything on a single page and then conditionally render the components I wanted.

I also wanted to implement some other stuff I was learning, like a cool animation library I was working with. I didn't know how to use React,
but coming from a design background, the component model of development just makes sense.
So when I did future projects I could just update one thing and keep an efficient workflow!

This refactor was my way of learning to use React. And a good foundation to build my knowledge upon!
